## Academic Background



## Research

My research focuses on the transfer of reading habits and skills in Chinese learners of English. Merging insights from usage-based linguistics and learning theory and applying eye-tracking as my main research method, my research aims to optimise the ways of teaching reading to Chinese EFL learners.
