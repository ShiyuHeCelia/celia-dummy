Install and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle add webrick
bundle exec jekyll server
```
View the live page using `localhost`:
<http://localhost:4000>. You can get the HTML files in `_site` folder.

### Using the HTML version

The compiled HTML files are available in the `html_source_file` folder. If you don't like Jekyll, you may directly edit and use the HTML version.
